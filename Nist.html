NIST National School of Sciences is a premier education institution, which was established in 1993. It is situated at Lainchour, strategically important location in the Kathmandu valley, and is one of the constituent institutions under the NIST Foundation. The school has been conducting Plus 2 programme (Grade 11 – 12), now Upper Secondary school classes, both in Science and Management for the last three decades. The school follows the national curriculum under the National Examination Board (NEB), Nepal. The school management is planning to introduce other courses in Law, Arts and Humanities in Grade 11–12 in the near future while the ultimate goal is to provide the continuum of education from Pre–school to Grade 12 under the National School of Sciences within the next few years.<p>

The NIST Foundation was initiated by a group of scientists and academicians. The core objectives were to establish academic institutions, and to provide students with quality education focusing primarily on science and technology so as to promote the science education in the country. At present, there are nine academic institutions including the National School of Sciences under the NIST Foundation, and they run classes from Pre–school to university level at different locations. The school has always emphasized the academic excellence of students and fostered a culture of innovation and collaboration. As a result, our students graduate with outstanding performance in the board examinations every year. Today, many of its alumni are engaged in the highly regarded professions and businesses within the country and abroad.<p>

Nearly 1,000 students are enrolled annually in the Science and Management Stream. The students are drawn from different provinces, diverse culture and ethnicity allowing them to engage in intercultural understanding and to experience a rich learning. The school provides students with ample opportunities to engage in co–curricular and extra–curricular activities that ensure their holistic development which enables them to succeed not only in higher education but in life as well. In addition, the school instills in students moral values such as integrity, responsibility, empathy, collaboration and respect that are essential for students to be a good human being while nurturing their full potential.<p><br><br>


<h2 align="center"><a style="color:#7FFD4;"><mark>Vision</mark></a></h2><br><br>

Our vision is to become a highly respected high school in the society where its students, staff and the community feel safe and valued, demonstrate their pride, share a love for learning, and students graduate with academic excellence to succeed in higher education and life.<P>

	<h2 align="center"><a style="color:#7FFD4;"><mark>Mission</mark></a> </h2><br><br>

	We provide our students with a holistic education in a caring, safe and supportive environment that fosters positive attitudes to learning and develops the intellectual, social and emotional skills as well as their physical well–being of students. We engage our parents as partners to facilitate students to achieve academic excellence, inspire lifelong learning, and become confident, engaged and responsible global citizens. We help students develop the 21st century skills – creativity, critical–thinking, collaboration, communication and positive attitude that are essential to succeed in life, higher education and beyond.<br><br><br>
